# Tazmyla Fireforge | [Character Sheet](https://ddb.ac/characters/43557636/zeugGx)

Tazmyla Fireforge ♀️ is a 4 foot 8 mountain dwarf.
Despite having her head tilted slightly downward, her emerald-green eyes feel like they are staring into the depths of your soul, while her amber hair waving in the wind calms you down in a most profound manner.
A most perplexing mixture of pain and joy glimmers in her eyes.
You are not quite sure if she is smiling or confused.

Despite being made from thick cloth, most likely some kind of cotton or wool, the long skirt, covering her legs, waves ever so slightly in the wind.
It is framed by a dark blue border, made from the same material.
The rounded tips of her thick leather boots, peak out from beneath this cozy looking skirt.
Her arms are covered in long sleeves, made from the same material as her skirt, reaching all the way to her wrists.
She seems to generally dress in subdued colors, mostly dark gray and slate, yet you can make out some more vibrant accents on her clothes.
The pouch she is wearing on her fabric belt is made of dark and well worn leather, bound with a light lavender cord.
You suspect the cord to be same used to bind a piece of light gray fur around her neck and over her shoulders.
The eyes through which the cord is threaded look like they are made from gold.
Her hands are partially covered by dark, woolen, finger less gloves.
You are drawn to the gold ring, she is wearing over the glove, on her right hand, in which is embedded a large, sharply faceted ruby.

You notice the skin of her fingers is worn, especially on the inside, her fingerprints almost completely rubbed away.
Even though you cannot be sure without asking her yourself, but it seem as though she mainly works with her hands.

Around her hip is wrapped a light gray cloth belt, accented with strips of the same dark blue material framing her skirt.
A dagger is bound to it at her right hip.
Its blade is made from a dark, yet shiny metal, shaped like a flame, flowing down into a brass hand guard.
The stock of the weapon is wrapped in dark brown leather, ending in a large, soft, drop shaped piece of sapphire.
Opposite of the dagger, a leather quiver is attached to her belt, containing the arrows for the wooden short-bow strapped to her back.
A triangular piece of dark blue cloth is bound around her upper right arm.
From its shape and size, you guess that she uses it as face mask when traveling through harsher climates, most likely in combination with the hood hanging over her short-bow.
Her chest and shoulders are protected by armor, made from light brown leather, outlined in the same dark leather making up her pouch.

While she does not speak, you hear the story she is telling loud and clear...

## Back Story

> **SPOILER ALERT** This is the back story of Tazmyla.
> Unless you don't plan on having her in a party with you, I suggest you stop reading here and that you try to find out all about her in a campaign.
> Still, you might want to look at the campaigns Tazmyla participated in by jumping to [Campaigns and Adventures](#campaigns-and-adventures)


Born as the daughter of a blacksmith father and a jewel mother, Tazmyla grew up in a small mountain village.
Her childhood was rather ordinary.
She spent most of her time learning her mothers trade, while never missing an opportunity to expand her knowledge by spending time in her fathers workshop.
Her mother often took her on trips to fairs an other cities, trading exquisite jewelry and gemstones.

Tazmyla developed a deep appreciation for peace and serenity early on in her life.
Her village had not been at war with any other faction for over a century.
Her upbringing imbued her with a fundamental respect for life, from the smallest insect to the largest creatures to ever roam the planet.
Nonetheless, there was an eternal flame burning deep inside her soul, as it is withing all of her kind.
This flame filled her with a deep passion she expressed through her intricate gemstone- and metalwork.
Sometimes she felt as if the stones were talking to her, telling tales of old times, tales of struggles and of hope.

Although she always was one the quietest children in her village, Tazmyla was well liked by the others.
She enjoyed working on jewelry alone in her mothers workshop, yet never missed a festival or party, laughing and joking with her friends.

On one of the trading trips with her mother, during her mid-teenage years, Tazmyla encountered a feeling she had never known before.
They spent five days in a somewhat remote city, buying and selling gemstones and jeweler's tools.
They must have talked to and haggled with dozens of people, dwarfs and others alike, when her gaze met with the sky-blue eyes of a teenage dwarven girl.
She didn't know how, but she felt as if hundreds of butterflies had suddenly materialized in stomach.
As Tazmyla soon found out, the girl was called Armera, Armera Brightblaze.
Every free minute, she did not have to help out her mother at their market stand, Tazmyla spent chatting with Armera.
They talked about everything, as though they had known each other since childhood.
Almost everything.

Each time Tazmyla and her mother returned to this city, she spent most of her time with Armera.
After every single time meeting Armera, Tazmyla promised herself, that one day she would have the courage to talk to Armera about what she felt.
Next time..., next time for certain.

First months, then years went by, with Tazmyla carefully navigating around the issue at hand, secretly cursing herself on the inside.
After an especially cold and snowy winter, Tazmyla was more excited than ever when the next trip to the hometown of Armera came around.
She had so much to tell her.
For one, Tazmyla had taken up pottery, a relatively unusual craft for dwarfs.
She had successfully combined the art of cutting gemstones with the creation of impressive earthenware figurines.
But more importantly, this would be the trip she would open herself up completely to Armera, regardless of what she might think.
When Tazmyla and her mother arrived at the city, she hastily set up the market stand, struggling to contain her excitement.
Having finished the stand, she started to wander around the city, looking out for the waving walnut hair and dreamy sky-blue eyes.
But they were nowhere to be found.
Maybe Armera was traveling herself, or she was just busy helping out her father, who was the local stone cutter.
The days went by, and Tazmyla did not catch as much as a glimpse of Armera's bright green flax tunic and leather pants.

It was not until the second to last day of their stay, that Tazmyla caught word of what was going on with Armera.
And what she heard caused her heart to sink like stone to the bottom of the deepest lake.
Armera had moved to a different city... with her newly-wed husband.
In one fell swoop, all her hopes, her fantasies were taken away from Tazmyla.
The flame inside her soul started to grow.
She felt how she was loosing control over it, how she wanted to loose control.
But she had to keep up her facade.
No one, not even her mother, knew her true feeling for Armera, and no one should ever know.
And then there was the market stand.
After all, she had promised her mother to help her out.

After returning from the trade trip, nothing felt as it was before to Tazmyla.
All of the figurines, bracelets, and necklaces felt wrong.
The sun shining on the forest outside their village felt as if it was mocking her.
With no one to share her pain with, Tazmyla began to hide away completely in her mothers workshop, even though she did not feel like putting her soul and passion into the creation of anything new.
At times, she asked herself if there was any soul left inside herself, or if it too moved on with Armera.

After months of hiding and isolating herself, there was a knock on the workshop door.
This in itself was curious enough, considering that no one outside her family was allowed in the small room.
Even more unexpected however, was the person knocking on the door.
A slender half-elf, his age showing clearly on his face stood in front of Tazmyla when she opened the door.
As she quickly found out, he was the founder of a mixed faith monastery.
He was offering her a place to find rest and to able to search for what it was    that defined herself.
Anticipating her questions, he told her that her parents had sent for him, that they were worried about her, and they they believed she needed to find herself again.
Having talked to the half-elf for a few minutes, Tazmyla realized her parents were standing right behind him the whole time.
She exchanged a few deep glances with them, and then agreed to take this opportunity to heal.

In the monastery, people from all over the world lived lone in small, isolated rooms.
While they took their meals and even sometimes worked together, they all did so in complete silence.
All of them had taken a vow of silence, allowing every person to focus on their inner self.
After some weeks of doing nothing, Tazmyla began to rediscover her love for gemstones and pottery.
She sat in the collective workshop of the monastery, sometimes for more than 12 hours at a time, working on intricately patterned rubies and amethysts.
She carved the most beautiful eyes of blue opal for her figurines... all of them wearing green tunics.

After living in complete isolation for almost three years, something started to churn inside her chest.
A longing for what could only be found, if she allowed herself to return to the outside world.
A longing for her parents.
A longing for new experiences.

#### Muckley

Upon arriving at Muckley, Tazmyla met a dwarven trader at one of the market stands.
His selection of wares was good, however, nothing really stood out to her.
Besides being a remarkably unremarkable town, it is extremely cold in and around the village.
Almost supernaturally cold...

From the distance, she heard the agitated voice of a woman, shouting at an Elf surrounded by two guards.
Stepping closer she met up with the rest of the party and found out that the woman was in distress about her two children being kidnapped.
Together with the remainder of the party, she set out to find those children (*twins named Emil and Erna, aged 13*) and return them to her.
The Elf, who the woman shouted at, turned out to be the head of the local watch.
He promised to pay each member of the party **80GP**, if the manage to return the children.
Tazmyla scoffed at Plätsch and ??? who tried to bargain up the reward.
The head of the watch agreed to extend the reward to a stay of two or three days an Inn (food and drinks included).

#### Old Pirate Ship

Upon entering the forest, the party stumbled upon an old pirate ship.
Tazmyla detected a number of footprints (small animals as well as **humanoid**) around the ship.
Without much hesitation, Arnall entered the ship, just to be attacked by something he could not see.
As it turned out, there were three zombies hiding (most likely the old crew of the ship), hiding out inside the body of the ship.
Naturally, a battle ensued in which Tazmyla managed to take down her first opponent, stabbing one of the zombies in its head using her dagger.
In the remains of the battle, the party found five healing potions.
Additionally, Tazmyla managed to find **50SP**.
Eladriel sent out his familiar in order to scout the area around the ship, however, due to the (possibly) magical nature of the winter in the forest, *Archibald* did not spot anything.
??? used their perception to try and find out more about the difficulties the party had in the forest.
They managed to feel that the party was being watched through the trees.
Unfortunately, they were not able to figure out who/what was watching the party.

#### Deeper Into the Forest

Continuing deeper into the forest, the party came upon a small campsite, in which a Drow ♂️ was sitting besides a small campfire.
Surrounding the campsite were several, what seemed to be, statues made of ice.
??? and ??? approached the Drow and tried to engage with him.
At the same time, Tazmyla took a closer look at the statues, determining them to not in fact be actual statues.
The Drow was just giggling and murmuring to himself, while drawing on a piece of paper.
??? tried to intimidate the him but failed, causing the Drow to laugh at them.
A little heated by the laughter ??? tried to also intimidate the Drow and succeeded, causing him to run away into the forest.
With the Drow gone, ??? and ??? rummaged through his belongings, uncovering a diary, some "used" tissues, and a erotic picture of a female Drow.
Reading through the diary, ??? figured out that the original owner was hiding out here in the forest, feeling rejected by his people.
Arnall expressed his strong disapproval with ??? and ??? going through the Drow's belongings.
??? dugg a little deeper around the campsite but found only some rotting remains of food.
Tazmyla tried to stealthily snatch the picture but was found out by the rest of the party, all of which silently expressed the confusion and disgust.
Braking the uncomfortable silence, ??? approached Tazmyla and inquired her to clarify what she meant by saying that the statues are not actual statues.
She explained that, despite them *looking* like statues, there where neither tool marks nor any other signs of them having been constructed.
Fascinated, and slightly unsettled, by her explanation, the party continued onward, deeper into the forest.
