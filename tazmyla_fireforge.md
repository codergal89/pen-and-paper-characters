#### Muckley

Upon arriving at Muckley, Tazmyla met a dwarven trader at one of the market stands.
His selection of wares was good, however, nothing really stood out to her.
Besides being a remarkably unremarkable town, it is extremely cold in and around the village.
Almost supernaturally cold...

From the distance, she heard the agitated voice of a woman, shouting at an Elf surrounded by two guards.
Stepping closer she met up with the rest of the party and found out that the woman was in distress about her two children being kidnapped.
Together with the remainder of the party, she set out to find those children (*twins named Emil and Erna, aged 13*) and return them to her.
The Elf, who the woman shouted at, turned out to be the head of the local watch.
He promised to pay each member of the party **80GP**, if the manage to return the children.
Tazmyla scoffed at Plätsch and ??? who tried to bargain up the reward.
The head of the watch agreed to extend the reward to a stay of two or three days an Inn (food and drinks included).

#### The Forest 

Upon entering the forest, the party stumbled upon an old pirate ship.
Tazmyla detected a number of footprints (small animals as well as **humanoid**) around the ship.
Without much hesitation, Arnall entered the ship, just to be attacked by something he could not see.
As it turned out, there were three zombies hiding (most likely the old crew of the ship), hiding out inside the body of the ship.
Naturally, a battle ensued in which Tazmyla managed to take down her first opponent, stabbing one of the zombies in its head using her dagger.
