# Tazmyla Fireforge | [Character Sheet](https://ddb.ac/characters/39827951/QKQpOt) | [Back Story](back_stories/tazmyla_fireforge.md)

Tazmyla Fireforge ♀️ is a 4 foot 8 mountain dwarf.
Despite having her head tilted slightly downward, her emerald-green eyes feel like they are staring into the depths of your soul, while her amber hair waving in the wind calms you down in a most profound manner.
A most perplexing mixture of pain and joy glimmers in her eyes.
You are not quite sure if she is smiling or confused.

Despite being made from thick cloth, most likely some kind of cotton or wool, the long skirt, covering her legs, waves ever so slightly in the wind.
It is framed by a dark blue border, made from the same material.
The rounded tips of her thick leather boots, peak out from beneath this cozy looking skirt.
Her arms are covered in long sleeves, made from the same material as her skirt, reaching all the way to her wrists.
She seems to generally dress in subdued colors, mostly dark gray and slate, yet you can make out some more vibrant accents on her clothes.
The pouch she is wearing on her fabric belt is made of dark and well worn leather, bound with a light lavender cord.
You suspect the cord to be same used to bind a piece of light gray fur around her neck and over her shoulders.
The eyes through which the cord is threaded look like they are made from gold.
Her hands are partially covered by dark, woolen, finger less gloves.
You are drawn to the gold ring, she is wearing over the glove, on her right hand, in which is embedded a large, sharply faceted ruby.

You notice the skin of her fingers is worn, especially on the inside, her fingerprints almost completely rubbed away.
Even though you cannot be sure without asking her yourself, but it seem as though she mainly works with her hands.

Around her hip is wrapped a light gray cloth belt, accented with strips of the same dark blue material framing her skirt.
A dagger is bound to it at her right hip.
Its blade is made from a dark, yet shiny metal, shaped like a flame, flowing down into a brass hand guard.
The stock of the weapon is wrapped in dark brown leather, ending in a large, soft, drop shaped piece of sapphire.
Opposite of the dagger, a leather quiver is attached to her belt, containing the arrows for the wooden short-bow strapped to her back.
A triangular piece of dark blue cloth is bound around her upper right arm.
From its shape and size, you guess that she uses it as face mask when traveling through harsher climates, most likely in combination with the hood hanging over her short-bow.
Her chest and shoulders are protected by armor, made from light brown leather, outlined in the same dark leather making up her pouch.

While she does not speak, you hear the story she is telling loud and clear...

#### Muckley

Upon arriving at Muckley, Tazmyla met a dwarven trader at one of the market stands.
His selection of wares was good, however, nothing really stood out to her.
Besides being a remarkably unremarkable town, it is extremely cold in and around the village.
Almost supernaturally cold...

From the distance, she heard the agitated voice of a woman, shouting at an Elf surrounded by two guards.
Stepping closer she met up with the rest of the party and found out that the woman was in distress about her two children being kidnapped.
Together with the remainder of the party, she set out to find those children (*twins named Emil and Erna, aged 13*) and return them to her.
The Elf, who the woman shouted at, turned out to be the head of the local watch.
He promised to pay each member of the party **80GP**, if the manage to return the children.
Tazmyla scoffed at Plätsch and ??? who tried to bargain up the reward.
The head of the watch agreed to extend the reward to a stay of two or three days an Inn (food and drinks included).

#### Old Pirate Ship

Upon entering the forest, the party stumbled upon an old pirate ship.
Tazmyla detected a number of footprints (small animals as well as **humanoid**) around the ship.
Without much hesitation, Arnall entered the ship, just to be attacked by something he could not see.
As it turned out, there were three zombies hiding (most likely the old crew of the ship), hiding out inside the body of the ship.
Naturally, a battle ensued in which Tazmyla managed to take down her first opponent, stabbing one of the zombies in its head using her dagger.
In the remains of the battle, the party found five healing potions.
Additionally, Tazmyla managed to find **50SP**.
Eladriel sent out his familiar in order to scout the area around the ship, however, due to the (possibly) magical nature of the winter in the forest, *Archibald* did not spot anything.
??? used their perception to try and find out more about the difficulties the party had in the forest.
They managed to feel that the party was being watched through the trees.
Unfortunately, they were not able to figure out who/what was watching the party.

#### Deeper Into the Forest
