# Tarsi Riverroot | [Character Sheet](https://ddb.ac/characters/43703969/Xt5LzU)

You see a 5 foot 11 human ♀️ of average build in front of you.
Her shoulder-long, light auburn hair is neatly bound into a smoothly flowing ponytail.
The moon-light glitters on her pale blue eyes, radiating a ghostly aura which stands in stark contrast to her amber skin.
A deep scar, running from above her left eye, down to her cheek, catches your eyes.
She smiles at you, inviting you to have a chat.

Partially hidden beneath an indigo vest, an ivory colored blouse covers her chest and arms, the puffy sleeves tightly bound around her wrists.
You are not sure as to whether or not the blouse used to be white.
Around her neck, she carries a simple silver chain, onto which a golden ring is threaded.
A sharply faceted ruby is expertly inlaid into the the ring, which seems to be be too small to fit her hands.
If you would need to make a guess, you would say it was made to fit a dwarf.
A black leather belt binds long, loosely fitting indigo pants to her hips.
She wears them stuffed into worn, black leather boots, bound using lavender laces, threaded through brass eyelets.
Attached to her belt, so see a number of tools, some of which you cannot even begin to guess what they are used for.
On her left, a multitude of small pouches and a pair of thick leather gloves dangle, attached to two light brown leather straps that are bound around her thigh.
Bound around her right thigh, you notice a single dark brown leather strap, studded with 5 brass eyelets.
Attached to one of the eyelets, using what looks to be the same lavender string used to lace her shoes, is a simple sheathed dagger.

Upon closer inspection, you notice some small cuts, burns, and calluses on her hands.
Suddenly it seems obvious to you... she is one of those tinkerers... wait what do people call them... Ah! Artificers!
You step closer and start asking her about her magi-mechanical inventions...

## Backstory
> **SPOILER ALERT** This is the back story of Tarsi.
> Unless you don't plan on having her in a party with you, I suggest you stop reading here and that you try to find out all about her in a campaign.

Tarsi's family spent the majority of time traveling Faerûn her childhood years.
Her parents were always very protective of Tarsi, trying to shield her from any hardships.
They ultimately settled down in the Dock Ward of Waterdeep, where her parents found any number of odd, and sometimes shady, jobs to make a living.
However, being a city of over a million inhabitants, Tarsi's mother found it ever more difficult to shield her daughter from the fact that they were barely scraping by.

Being the oldest of three children, Tarsi started working at the age of 11 in order to support her parents and give them some room to breathe.
She mostly worked in cleaning decks on ships that had anchored at Waterdeep.
Although her employers often did not care too much for her as a person, she quickly became known for being efficient at her job.
During her work she often overheard stories of faraway lands, planting the seed of a desire to see more of the world.
Although her job was hard and did not pay all that well, it was these stories that helped her make it through the days.
She knew however, that her family relied on her contributions, keeping the dreams of finding a place of her own just that... dreams.

Several years went by, every day being filled with the same routine.
That was why she was utterly surprised when, on the night of 19th birthday, her parents came to her small little room and sat down on her simple straw bed.
They had an unusually serious expression on their faces.
Her mother explained to her, that they knew of her desire to find her own place in the world.
Apparently, her parents had often overheard Tarsi talking in her sleep, about places she imagined out in the world.
Tarsi was torn between helping her parents and brothers on one hand and her burning desire to explore the Faerûn.
She took some time to discuss her feelings with her parents, making sure they and her brothers would be o.k.
In the end, her desire for exploration took over and with a heavy heart, Tarsi went out to find her own way in life.

One of her first destinations was the city of Muckley, between Neverwinter and Luskan.
Talking to the inhabitants, Tarsi learned that the city had recently been freed from an internal winter that had been imposed by a crazed wizard.
Wandering around the town and searching for a place to sleep, Tarsi stumbled into the local inn.


[SOMEHOW TARSI WENT OUT TRAVELING THE SWORD COAST BEFORE "Poisoned Skies"]

> **NOTE** Needs fleshing out.
> Will be done later on.
> In essence, Tarsi (ca. 19 at the time) met Tazmyla Fireforge (ca. 24 at the time), a mountain dwarf traveling the Sword Coast on her own, after an adventure (Tazmylas Adventure) on a permanently frozen peninsula.
> Tazmyla accepted Tarsi without any prejudice, being the gentle and curious soul she was.
> Both traveled together for about 5 years, mostly keeping away from cities and towns, foraging and exploring.
> During their travels, Tarsi and Tazmyla became much more than friends, something that goes beyond family and beyond lovers, they felt like they shared a single soul. (Yes it's kind of stolen from the relationship between Jean-Luc Picard and Guinan, sue me :P)
> When ever the opportunity presented itself, Tazmyla taught Tarsi all she knew about the manufacturing of jewelry and how to work with gemstones and metal.
> Tarsi took up mechanical tinkering and spends much of her downtime working on new inventions.

> Although they enjoyed traveling, it was a harsh life, leaving little time for their respective trades/hobbies.
> For that reason, they decided to settle down on the outskirts of Asterlyn, a village Tazmylas mother did a lot of trade with when Tazmyla was in her teenage years.
> While not necessarily overly excited with having a Tiefling in their midst, the people of Asterlyn trusted Tazmylas judgement.
> Still, they are not exceedingly friendly with her, but they (mostly) accept her.
